# NoMuDo
NoMuDo stands for NodeJS Music Downloader.
NoMuDo is a Web server used to:
- easily download music you find online (e.g. on Youtube or on SoundCloud)
- listen to the downloaded music via a minimalistic Web player


# Getting started
- `git clone https://github.com/davidrapin/nomudo.git` to download the code
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to start the Web server (listening on port `3232` by default)
- open http://localhost:3232
- log in (using the default username/password: `user`/`password`)
- download your first song by pasting the song URL in the download bar (e.g. this [free song from youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lbbHQbZNKg))

Remember to change the default username and password!

# Editing the configuration
The configuration gets generated in `./nomudo-options.json`, you can edit the folder into which music gets downloaded, as well as your username and password.
Note: do not edit this file while NoMuDo is running, your changes will be lost.
